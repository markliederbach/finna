## Run `format` task to fix up data

```bash
âžœ task format
task: [format] go run cmd/finna/main.go format -i input.csv -o output.csv
{"level":"info","msg":"Running finna","version":"latest"}
{"args":{"OutputFormat":"stock-events","InputFile":"input.csv","OutputFile":"output.csv"},"level":"info","msg":"Running format command"}
{"level":"info","msg":"Found 133 CSV rows"}
```

This task will filter out transactions that don't affect holdings, sort by date, and dump into a CSV format that is required by Stock Events.

Note that duplicate transactions will be ignored, so this operation should be safe to run as many times as necessary.
